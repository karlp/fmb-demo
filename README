FreeModbus example code, using libopencm3 as the hardware layer.

Developed and tested primarily on the stm32l discovery board, edit "syscfg.h"
in each directory to setup rs485 DE pin, led pins and uart pins.

Status
* opencm3-raw:  Working just fine with real rs485 hw.
* opencm3-freemodbus:  Working just fine with real rs485 hw.

Plans:
 * Examples with other RTOSs
